Tic Tac Toe, with a twist




Help
==========

Turn Tac Toe is not your tradition version, it has a few twists.
As you play, depending on the mode, and difficulty, the board turns. I know, I know, sounds hard to play, it's not. When I say, "the board turns", what I really mean is, the values in the boxes surrounding the center square trade in a counter clockwise fashion.
